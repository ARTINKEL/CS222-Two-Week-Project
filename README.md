Two Week Project. Austin Tinkel and Allie Curtis

We were tasked with creating an application for the Orwellian News Service (ONS). Our application would take live data from Wikipedia, and display the most recent 30 edits to any page. It would display who made the changes at what time. The user can sort the revision list by timestamp or number of edits by an individual user.
